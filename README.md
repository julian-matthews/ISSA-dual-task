# Dual-Task
**ISSA2017 Psychophysics Hands-on Project**
## Coordinators
1. Nao Tsuchiya (Monash University)
2. Julian Matthews (Monash University)
3. Katsunori Miyahara (Rikkyo University)
4. Elizaveta Solomonova (University of Montreal)

## Outline
The aim of this hands-on project is to introduce two exemplar visual psychophysics paradigms. By experiencing what psychophysics tasks are like, students will be able to design their own experiment. Also, students will learn some basic analysis concepts: objective performance and [metacognitive sensitivity](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00443/full), each based on [signal detection theory](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2004-19022-000). A broader aim is to consider what these behavioural techniques might tell us about consciousness and related processes (such as attention, memory and metacognition). 

Here we provide MATLAB code for building psychophysics experiments that employs a **Dual-Task**. Students are encouraged to modify this code to examine their own research questions in collaboration with the coordinators.

## You will need: 
1. **MATLAB**
2. [**Psychtoolbox**](http://psychtoolbox.org/)
3. [Monitor set to 60Hz]: "This experiment has been coded to present items at specific frames. Stimuli will appear much too quickly at higher framerate settings"

## Description:
The experiment included in this repository employs a dual-task design to examine the relationship between [attention and consciousness](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Naotsugu_Tsuchiya/publication/309702790_Relationship_between_selective_visual_attention_and_visual_consciousness/links/58638e3f08aebf17d3973831.pdf). Our implementation of the dual-task design here draws many features from a 2004 study conducted by [Leila Reddy and colleagues](http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2121636). Clone or download the repository to examine how it works.
